# ReinforcementLearning
Folder containing all my projects in Reinforcement Learning.


1. [Flappy Bird Game](https://github.com/omeurer/ReinforcementLearning/blob/main/FlappyBird_RL.ipynb)
   This project implements 2 agents (a Monte Carlo and Sarsa-Lambda) from scratch, using an already-implemented environment of the game Flappy Bird.
   It works very well on Notebook, even with a dynamic rendering.

   *Spoiler : the bird flaps well.*
